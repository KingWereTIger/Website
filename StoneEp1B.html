        <p>DR.STONE 
        </p>
        <p>
          Starting out:
          Dr.Stone is a TV anime series produced by TMS Entertainment based on the manga which is writen by Riichiro Inagaki, Illustrated by Boichi and Published in Shueisha's Weekly Shōnen Jump magazine. It is a great series consisting of versitale and fun characters in a well thought out plot where the main cast needs to repopulate the world after 3700 years stuck in a stone prison created by a weird light. We follow the genious boy Senku Ishigami emereging to a "Stone world".

          Episode 1 / Season 1

          "Stone World"
          </p>
          <p>
          Light Spoilers :
          The episode starts out with us seeing Teiju and Senku talking to each other about Teiju's love and fear of rejection. This first part already represented us with the 2 main characters of the show and starting at us with a flex of Senku's intelligence when he "Tries" to fix Teiju's problem by giving him a "Love potion". This part in itself really showed us not even the characters themselves but even their personality and common traits such as Teiju being the Strong and White hearted person and Senku being the smart one. After a smart refusal we se Teiju going out to her crush where the Fatal thing happens and everyone turns into stone. After a long 3700 years of waiting we see a confused Teiju and a Senku trying to Repopulate the planet once again.

          Highlights about the Episodes:
          The Scary truth: In the first episode we uncover the fact the the world is set up in a way that is kind of scary. In the first 3 minutes we see that everyone turns into stone, we see people dying, cars crashing and planes falling out of the sky. Everyone was dying and being turned to stone and this went on for 3700 where we see a destroyed world with the only living things being the animals.

          <p>
          Great Sience: The sience isn't pretty standard to the normal world but it is extremely accurate, even in the first episode (which is only the start) we see a lot of experiments and creations. This just shows me that not only is the show great at giving a story and animation but to show true to life facts which may help you in undertsanding science better.
          </p>
          <p>
          The Animation: We can clearly see that the animation on every point is special, if you look at it with the first glace you can clearly see animation which spells "WAR" like a shoenen anime which really surprised me when i first saw it too see a more scienfitic approach and a more story and advernture based show.

          Personal Opinion:
          Normally I am really hesitant on seeing hyped anime in the fear I will be dissapointed, but Dr.stone was a different expreience to me, everything I saw about it in the first episode was great, I am not the person who has seen every episode one by one but a person giving a honest review to a new anime which he is juding himself first. I can say some things that I've seen wrong but most of it is great without much need of improvement

          I felt as the episode was pretty great. It started out telling us about the main cast which we will follow in all 24 episodes of the first season and the ones we will relate the most after this accident. The first episode also teaches us the reason on why everyone was so far into the future and a reason on why this happened, even if the light still remains as a plot hole it helps us get a better understanding of the plot and the time of the happenings. At first glance the episode may start as a romantic/jerky episode but you later realise the depth of it just by listening to 24 minutes of well writen dialogue.We can clearly see that the animation on every point is special, if you look at it with the first glace you can clearly see animation which spells "WAR" like a shoenen anime which really surprised me when i first saw it too see a more scienfitic approach and a more story and advernture based show. Myself i am pretty impressed with this episode itself and think it is one of the better openings for most animes. Most of them leave many plot holes when starting or make weak representations, unlike Dr.Stone

          Recommendation:
          I would give the episode a great 7.5/10 , missing some minor details but overall a great episode with a lot of nice things to uncover.
          Would personally recommend this anime to every starter or anime fan
